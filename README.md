# learning_projects (Machine Learning & AI Projects)
This repository contains hands-on ML/AI projects I've completed for learning purposes. Most projects are adapted from online courses (DataCamp, Coursera, etc.) and built into portfolio-quality implementations. Badminton-related projects are NOT included here (found in the `badminton` folder instead).

## Projects

- `multi-input-ocr/` â€” OCR classification using images + type metadata (PyTorch)

Each folder contains its own notebook, README, and results. All code is original unless otherwise noted.
